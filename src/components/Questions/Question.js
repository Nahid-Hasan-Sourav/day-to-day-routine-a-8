        <strong>React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 'V' denotes the view in MVC. ReactJS is an open-source, component-based front end library responsible only for the view layer of the application. It is maintained by Facebook.Its aim is to allow developers to easily create fast user interfaces for websites and applications alike. The main concept of React. js is virtual DOM. It's used for building interactive user interfaces and web applications quickly and efficiently with significantly less code than you would with vanilla JavaScript.ReactJS divides the UI into isolated reusable pieces of code known as components. React components work similarly to JavaScript functions as they accept arbitrary inputs called properties or props. It's possible to have as many components as necessary without cluttering your code.</strong>

        <strong> State is the local state of the component which cannot be accessed and modified outside of the component. It's equivalent to local variables in a function. Props, on the other hand, make components reusable by giving components the ability to receive data from their parent component in the form of props.</strong>

        <strong>It can Perform asynchronous actions and It's can render comonents, when it's needs.We can use unpredictable timing functions like setTimeout or setInterval.We can consider side-effect by setting up a timer. the useEffect() is used for causing side effects in functional components and it is also capable for handling life-cycle methods of class based components into functional component.
